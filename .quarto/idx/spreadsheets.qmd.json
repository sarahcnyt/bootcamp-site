We'll discuss how to go about that in class, following along with this old piece from Derek Willis: \"[Take an interviewing approach to find stories in data](https://mediashift.org/2014/07/take-an-interviewing-approach-to-find-stories-in-data/)\"\n\n\n* Day 1: We'll go through [filtering](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/xl-filter-sort.html) and [pivot tables](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/xl-pivot.html) using data from the Washington Post's police shooting data. \n\n* Day 2:  We'll walk through how to do math on spreadsheets using the [Excel Formulas](https://cronkitedata.github.io/djtextbook/xl-formulas.html) exercise on a budget. \n\n## Homework\n\nYour homework is shown in Canvas. It consists of two parts: \n\n1. A dataset of animals impounded by the Maricopa County Animal Care and Control department. This will be used for filtering and pivot tables. \n\n2. A story and dataset of Census population estimates for cities and towns in Georgia. You will replicate some of the sentences from that story. I'll get you started on this with a strategy during class. \n\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"spreadsheets.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","theme":"flatly","title":"Spreadsheets in journalism"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
